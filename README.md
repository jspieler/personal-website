# Personal Website
My responsive personal website built using JavaScript, React and CSS and based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Currently, this is my project to learn JavaScript and React. The original design is from [Cryptical Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aCoZudPEKE&list=RDCMUCzDPCRJHfPusmXd6zl8bE7w&index=2).

See: 

The website provides, among other things, following features:

- Light and dark theme switch
- Carousels/slides using Swiper JS
- Modals
- A filterable portfolio gallery
- Contact form submission using JS
- Bilingual (English/German) impressum
- Self-hosted Google fonts
