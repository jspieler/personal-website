# About
It all started as a project to learn JavaScript, React and CSS. But when I was preparing a Python lecture, I got the idea to use it to create a kind of interactive lecture notes. The combination of explanations and executable code provides a great learning opportunity.

The website provides, among other things, following features:

- Light and dark theme switch
- Carousels/slides using Swiper JS
- Modals
- A filterable portfolio gallery
- Contact form submission using JS
- Bilingual (English/German) impressum
- Self-hosted Google fonts
